"""The roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, a â‰  0 are given by the following formula:
quadratic equation
In this formula, the term b2 - 4ac is called the discriminant.
If b2 - 4ac = 0, then the equation has two equal roots.
If b2 - 4ac > 0, the equation has two real roots.
If b2 - 4ac < 0, the equation has two complex roots."""
